Solo project unit in the Scrimba Learn Javascript course. Implemented from scratch using figma mockup as reference. This password generator is built in vanilla JS and provides a user with 2 randomized passwords per request. Users have an option to choose the length of the passwords (default is 15 characters) and whether or not to use numbers and special characters (default is to use them).
